I first saw that the filter field excepted user input and used the SQL injection based on ""="". To execute this, I typed "or""=" into the filter field. From there the flag appeared. This approach worked because it manipulates the SQL statement the server will create. When it read the results you get an empty string followed by an OR operand followed by the ""="" statement which is always true. This allowed me to gain access to all the posts made by the admin which is where one of the flags were hidden.
